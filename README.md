# Airbnb Database using Flask

How to run application:
1. Download Flask - if Flask is not already downloaded to your computer, you would have to run 'pip3 install flask'; More information: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/

2. On line 11 of app.py in the finalProject folder, that is where the creation of the database occurs, you'll have to change the password to your MySQL password 

3. To run the application, cd into the finalProject folder and enter "python3 app.py" in the command line; this process may take about a minute or 2 to load

4. Once the application is loaded and running, you can enter http://localhost:5000/ on Chrome and you will be taken to the application

5. When searching for Host ID, these numbers were used for testing: 31481 and 8607308, but other ID can be used with the Find other Host filter; Listing IDs can also be found with those search options as well.

6. To exit the app, press CTRL+C

All requirements were met and comments were made as to where they happened. 
Note: If a url does not work from Airbnb, that is because the listing was taken down
